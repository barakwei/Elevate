Elevate
=========

Do you open command line often? using keyboard shortcut for 'cmd'?
Isn't it annoying that you open command prompt, cd into a directory, execute a script or executable, just to find out you didn't run the cmd process as administrator?

Elevate tries to help with this problem.
Just compile Elevate and throw it into the %windir%\system32 directory and you're done!
Next time you find yourself with an unelevated command prompt, just type elevate, and after the UAC dialog, a new cmd windows will open in the same directory as the original window, so you don't have to cd again.
